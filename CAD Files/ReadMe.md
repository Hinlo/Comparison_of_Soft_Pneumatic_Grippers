# CAD Files
Here you can find .obj files for the three and four-fingered grippers 
(templated off of the two-fingered gripper provided by Bristol University's Soft Robotics Course Leaders).

In addition, you can find .obj files for the improved gripper suggested in the conclusion of the report and the quantiative comparison of the sphere and pneumatic finger
curvature (finger 1 of the three-fingered gripper).
